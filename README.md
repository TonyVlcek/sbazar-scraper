# SBazar Scraper

Simple command line tool written in PHP that allows you to scrape information from https://www.sbazar.cz/ which is a Czech online second-hand store.

To get it working:
1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `composer install`.
3. Run `./scraper scrape` in the root folder of the project (make sure that the file has _execute_ permissions).

At the moment this is only a prototype and a proof of concept so the command only scrapes the first page of the newest bike listings on SBazar (url https://www.sbazar.cz/628-kola/cela-cr/cena-neomezena/nejnovejsi).
